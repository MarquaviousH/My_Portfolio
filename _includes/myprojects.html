    <h2>This current website!</h2>
    <p>
     I used githubm html, css, and docker to set up this website.
     This have been a great experience on familizing myself with HTML, CSS, and docker. 
     I used Docker to set up an jekyll and ruby environment to make a github page website.

    <p>Galaxy Space Destroyer is an acarde shooter. 
        The goal of the game is to destroy incoming 
        astroids and ships to get a high score.  
        I created this game with Unity.

    <h2>Welcome to the Guard</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Guard is a javafx and SQLute character sheet for the Role Playing game Mouse Guard.
        The application allows a user to create characters, update a characters, and delete characters for mouse guard on their local machine.
        For this project, I worked with Jenna Arson and Katelyn Crotts for our senior capstone project.
