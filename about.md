<h1>Background:</h1> 

Ever since I was young, I have been interested in technology. I can still remember the times when i would open my toys to see what was inside of them, to find what made them work. When I was in high school, I participated in a event called Hour of Code. We would go to the website and choose coding activities that interested us. I did an activity that let a user type in some code to move through a dungeon to get to treasure or exit. This was my first time coding. 

Jump a few years later, I'm a graudate from Georgia Southern University in Savannah, Georgia. I majored Computer Science. I graduated on December 10, 2022. Over these past four years of my undergrad, I have been president of Men of Vision of Excellence. Have learn more about programming, debugging, testing, implementing software, and what it takes to work as a team. My senior capstone class have took my knowledge and skills that gain from my outher courses and push them to another level. I learned so much and it was a good experience to learn more of time management and team communication.
