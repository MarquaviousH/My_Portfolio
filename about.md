Background: 

Ever since I was young, I have been interested in technology. I can still remember the times when i would open my toys to see what was inside of them, to find what made them work. When I was in high school, I participated in a event called Hour of Code. We would go to the website and choose coding activities that interested us. I did an activity that let a user type in some code to move through a dungeon to get to treasure or exit. This was my first time coding. 

Jump a few years later, I am currently a senior at Georgia Southern University in Savannah Georgia, studying computer science. I'm graduating in December 10, 2022.
